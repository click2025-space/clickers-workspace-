Build a modern, clean, and elegant web app UI called "Clickers Workspace" — a digital workspace for managing teams, organizing tasks, and working collaboratively in a virtual office environment.

⚡ General Theme:

Professional and minimalist look.

Colors: dark background with purple and blue accents (Clickers’ theme).

Rounded cards, soft shadows, and simple transitions on hover.

Built using React + TailwindCSS (no backend, no animations needed).

🧩 Main Pages / Components:

1. Dashboard Page

Shows overview of all projects and departments.

Each project displayed as a clean card with title, progress bar, and assigned team.

Top navbar with logo “Clickers Workspace” and user avatar.

2. Virtual Offices Page

Displays all departments (Design, Development, Marketing, Admin, etc.).

Each department shown as a rectangular card with icon, name, and list of team members.

Clicking a department opens its page with static “office view” — description, team, and task summary.

3. Tasks Board Page

Simple Kanban-style board (Frontend only).

Columns: “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”.

Each task is a draggable card (React DnD or basic implementation).

Each task shows title, assigned person, and due date.

4. Team Chat Page

Frontend-only chat layout (no backend).

Sidebar with list of members.

Main chat area with message bubbles styled in Clickers’ theme colors.

Input bar at the bottom (non-functional).

5. Members Page

Grid layout of all team members.

Each member has a profile card: photo, name, role, and department.

Option to add new members (Frontend form).

6. Settings Page

Basic theme options (Light / Dark).

Static controls for workspace name, departments, and colors.

🧱 Extra UI Elements:

Reusable sidebar with navigation links: Dashboard, Offices, Tasks, Chat, Members, Settings.

Header bar with search, notifications icon, and user menu.

Footer with “© Clickers 2025 – All Rights Reserved”.

🎨 Design Goals:

Keep everything clean, structured, and easy to use.

Focus on teamwork, productivity, and visual organization.

Make it look like a real internal workspace for the Clickers team.
